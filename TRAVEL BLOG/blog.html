                        <h2>The old lighthouse</h2>
                        In nineteenth century, the only light to guide ships coming to Pondicherry was atop the Red Hills which was inadequate. The project was finally taken up during the tenure of Governor Saint Simon in 1835. Louis Guerre was the engineer of the project. The foundation stone for the lighthouse was laid at the end of 1835 and the inauguration ceremony took place in February 1836.The height of the lighthouse is 29 meters. It has a round tower and a square base. The cost of construction was 10,000 francs. The foundation has a depth of nine meters. Its light beam could be seen from a distance of 15 miles. The light source consisted of six oil lamps and two reflectors. The light source was converted to electric lamps in 1913. The power of the lamp was increased in 1931.The new lamp had a range of 26 nautical miles. It took 36 seconds for one full rotation of the beam.

                    <p><h1>Passiflora foetida:</h1>
                        Passiflora foetida (common names: stinking passionflower, wild maracuja, bush passion fruit, wild water lemon,stoneflower,love-in-a-mist, or running pop) is a species of passion flower that is native to the southwestern United States (southern Texas and Arizona), Mexico,the Caribbean, Central America, and much of South America. It has been introduced to tropical regions around the world,such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, Hawaii, Africa, and The Maldives.It is a creeping vine like other members of the genus, and yields an edible fruit.The specific epithet, foetida, means "stinking" in Latin and refers to the strong aroma emitted by damaged foliage.This passion flower tolerates arid ground, but favours moist areas. It is known to be an invasive species in some areas.This plant is also a widely grown perennial climber, and has been used in traditional medicine.
                        <h1>Description:</h1>
                        The stems are thin and wiry, and are covered with minute sticky yellow hairs. Older stems become woody. The leaves are three- to five-lobed and viscid-hairy. When crushed, these leaves give off a pungent odor that some people consider unpleasant. 
                        The flowers are white to pale cream coloured, or pink to pale purple, about 5–6 cm diameter. The ripe fruit is globose, 2–3 cm diameter, yellow from the white-flowered form, and red from the pink form, although there are more than 50 variants (Vanderplank), and has numerous black seeds embedded in the pulp; the fruit are eaten and the seeds dispersed by birds.Passiflora foetida is able to trap insects on its bracts, which exude a sticky substance that also contains digestive enzymes. This minimizes predation on young flowers and fruits.Whether or not it gains nourishment from its prey is uncertain, and it is considered a protocarnivorous plant.
                        <h1>Uses:</h1>
                         The fruits are roughly the size of a ping pong ball or kumquat and contain a bluish-white pulp that is mildly sweet and delicately flavored. In the Philippines, the fruit of Passiflora foetida are known colloquially as marya-marya ('Little Mary'), kurombot, utot-utot, and santo papa (due to its resemblance to the Pope's mitre). Young leaves and plant tips are also edible. Dry leaves are used in tea in Vietnamese folk medicine to relieve sleeping problems, as well as treatment for itching and coughs.</br></br>
